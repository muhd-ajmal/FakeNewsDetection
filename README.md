## Introduction

Welcome to the FakeNews Detection Using BiLSTM project! This project aims to develop a fake news detection system using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) neural networks. With the proliferation of fake news in today's digital age, it's essential to have tools that can help identify and filter out misinformation. This project provides a tool for detecting fake news articles based on their textual content.

## Features

- Utilizes BiLSTM neural networks for text classification.
- Dataset preprocessing and text vectorization.
- Model training and evaluation.
- Easy-to-use API for detecting fake news in text.
- Sample Jupyter notebooks for experimentation.

## Demo

For a live demonstration of the FakeNews Detection model, you can visit our online demo [here](#) (insert the link to your demo).

## Installation
